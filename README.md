# Java Multithreading Servers

This is a multithreaded server.

## How it works ##

When a client sends the request, a thread is generated through which a user can communicate with the server. By generating multiple threads we can accept multiple requests from multiple clients at the same time.

## Prerequisites ##

Understanding of socket programming is not necessary but will be useful.

## Technology Stack ##

- Java

The use of java's io, net, and util library was necessary in order to create this.
